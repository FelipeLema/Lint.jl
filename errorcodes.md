| E411 | you cannot have non-default argument following default arguments
| E412 | named ellipsis ... can only be the last argument

| E414 | using is not allowed inside function definitions
| E415 | export is not allowed inside function definitions
| E416 | import is not allowed inside function definitions
| E417 | what is an anonymous function doing inside a type definition?
| E418 | RHS is a tuple of rhstype. N of variables used: len
| E418 | RHS is a tuple of rhstype. N of variables used: len
| E421 | use Union{...}, with curly, instead of parentheses
| E422 | string uses * to concatenate
| E423 | named keyword argument must have a default
| E424 | nested vect is treated as a 1-dimensional array. Use [a;b] instead
| E425 | use @lintpragma macro inside type declaration
| E431 | incorrect usage of length() in a Boolean context. You want to use isempty()
| E432 | though valid in 0.4, you want x() instead of y()
| E433 | for a decreasing range, use a negative step e.g. 10:-1:1
| E434 | value at position x is the referenced. Possible typo?
| E435 | new is provided with more arguments than fields
| E436 | more indices than dimensions
|      |         |
|      |         |
|**E5**| *Type Error*
|      |         |
| E511 | apparent non-Bool type

| E533 | type parameters in Julia are invariant, expression may not do what you want. Try f{T<:Number}(x::T)... 
| E534 | you mean {T<:X}? You are introducing it as a new name for an implicit argument to the function
| E535 | you mean {T<:X}? You are introducing it as a new name for an algebric data type
| E536 | you should use {T<:...} instead of a known type
| E537 | you want string(), i.e. string conversion, instead of a non-existent constructor

| I474 | iteration generates tuples of rhstype. N of variables used: len
| I481 | in 0.4+, replace x() with y()
| I482 | used in a local scope. Improve readability by using 'local' or another name

| I571 | the 1st statement under the true-branch is a boolean expression. Typo?
